2;"When the Customer enters into a contract with Mövenpick Hotels Deutschland GmbH (seat: Frankfurt am Main, Amtsgericht Frankfurt
am Main HRB108250, Germany) (Operating Company) for the rent of hotel rooms in one of the hotels operated by the Operating Company
in Germany, as well as other services rendered and goods delivered to the Customer in this context (Hotel Accommodation
Contract/Contract) these General Terms and Conditions become an integral part of the Contract.£
The Customer’s general terms and conditions apply only if this is previously expressly agreed.£
The contracting parties are Mövenpick Hotels Deutschland GmbH (Operating Company) and the Customer. The performance of the
Operating Company within the scope of the Contract is carried out by the particular hotel branch of the Operating Company (Hotel).
The Contract shall come into force upon the Hotel’s acceptance of the Customer’s offer.£
The Hotel is obliged to keep available the rooms reserved by the Customer and to render the agreed services. Should for unforeseen
reasons no room in the reserved category be available upon arrival, the Hotel will provide a room in the next higher category. Should no
room be available in the Hotel, the Hotel can organize accommodation in another, at least equivalent hotel. The Hotel does not assume
liability for the services of the other hotel operator. The Hotel provides transport to and from the other hotel with luggage as well as a three
minute international phone call, for the purpose of informing about the new address. Furthermore, the Hotel provides a voucher for an
equivalent hotel room valid for the guest’s next stay in the Hotel.£
The Customer is obliged to pay to the Hotel the agreed or applicable prices for the room rental and other services provided. This also
applies to services ordered directly by the Customer or via the Hotel, which a third party provides and the Hotel disburses.£
The Hotel’s prior written consent is required if the Customer wishes to sublet the provided rooms or use them for other than lodging
purposes. Insofar as the Customer is not a consumer, the extraordinary termination right in case of lacking consent of the Hotel, Section
540, paragraph 1, sentence 2 German Civil Code (BGB), is waived.£
The Customer does not have the right to be provided specific rooms, unless this is expressly agreed.£
Reserved rooms are available to the Customer from 3:00 p.m. on the agreed arrival date. The Customer cannot claim an earlier
handover.£
Rooms must be vacated and made available to the Hotel no later than 12:00 noon on the agreed departure date. Should the Customer
not adhere to this provision, the Hotel may charge 50% of the full accommodation rate (list price) for the delayed vacation of the room until
6:00 p.m., and 90% after 6:00 p.m. The Customer does not obtain any contractual claims hereby. The Customer is at liberty to prove that
the Hotel’s claim based on the use of the room does not exist or is much lower.£
The use for commercial purposes of photographs taken of the Hotel interior, both of the common areas and the Hotel rooms is
prohibited.£
The taxes, including local taxes, in effect at the time of conclusion of the Contract, are included in the agreed prices, with the exception
of locally levied taxes which are owed directly by the guest according to the particular municipal law, for example a visitor’s tax. If the
statutory value added tax is changed or if local taxes are newly introduced, changed or abolished after conclusion of the Contract, the
prices will be adjusted accordingly. Insofar as the Customer is a consumer, this only applies if four months have passed between the
conclusion and fulfilment of the Contract.£
Should the Customer wish to reduce the number of reserved rooms, the services of the Hotel or the Customer’s length of stay, the Hotel
can increase the price for the rooms and/or for the other services.£
Invoices from the Hotel without a payment date are due within ten days of receipt of the invoice.£
The Hotel can demand immediate payment of due debt from the Customer. The statutory rules concerning the consequences of default
of payment apply. The Hotel reserves the right to prove greater damage.£
The Customer may only set off a claim by the Hotel against a claim, which is undisputed or decided with final, res judicata effect.£
Upon conclusion of the Contract, the Hotel may require a reasonable advance payment or the provision of a security, such as a credit
card guarantee, from the Customer. In case of an advance payment on the website of Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts, the payment is
processed via Mövenpick Hotels Deutschland GmbH, the parent company of the Operating Company. Mövenpick Hotels Deutschland
GmbH forwards the payment to the respective Hotel and has only an intermediary role for the purpose of the credit card payment.£
Mövenpick Hotels Deutschland GmbH does not assume liability for the provision of the hotel services according to these General Terms
and Conditions and the Contract. The statutory provisions relating to advance payments or to securities in connection with package tours shall remain unaffected. The statutory rules concerning the consequences of default of payment apply.£
In justified cases, e.g. the Customer’s default in payment or the expansion of the scope of the Contract, the Hotel may, after the
conclusion of the Con-tract and up to the commencement of the stay, demand an advance payment or the provision of a security within the meaning of the above-mentioned No. 7.1 or an increase of the advance payment or security agreed upon in the Contract up to the total agreed remuneration. Furthermore, the Hotel is entitled, at the beginning of and during the stay, to demand a reasonable advance payment or the provision of
a security within the meaning of the above-mentioned No. 7.1 for existing and future claims arising from the Contract, insofar as such
advance payment has not already been made or such security not already been provided pursuant to the above-mentioned No.£
The Customer can only withdraw from the Contract if a right of withdrawal was explicitly agreed upon in the Contract, if a statutory right
of withdrawal exists or if the Hotel gives its explicit consent to the withdrawal. The agreement on a right of withdrawal as well as the consent
to withdrawal shall be made in writing.£
Insofar as the Hotel and the Customer have agreed upon a date for a possible withdrawal from the Contract at no cost, the Customer
may withdraw from the Contract up to that date, without incurring payment or damage claims by the Hotel.£
In case the Customer is not entitled to withdraw from the Contract, the agreed remuneration is owed, regardless of whether the agreed
services are used. If the Hotel can rent out the rooms to other customers, it must credit the income and the saved expenses against the
agreed remuneration. If the rooms are not rented out to other customers, the Hotel can assess a lump sum for the saved expenses. In this
case, the Customer is obligated to pay at least 90% of the contractually agreed total rate for lodging with or without breakfast as well as all-
inclusive arrangements with external services, 70% for half-board and 60% for full-board arrangements. The Customer is at liberty to prove
that the above-mentioned claim does not exist or does not amount to the demanded sum.£
Insofar as it was agreed that the Customer can withdraw from the Contract at no cost up to a certain date, the Hotel may also withdraw
from the Con-tract up to this date, if the Customer does not, upon inquiry by the Hotel with a reasonable grace period, waive its right of
withdrawal.£
The Hotel may also withdraw from the Contract if the Customer does not pay an advance payment or provide a security agreed upon or
demanded pursuant to No. 7.1 and/or No. 7.2, even after a reasonable grace period set by the Hotel has expired.£
Moreover, the Hotel has the right of extraordinary withdrawal from the Contract for a materially justifiable cause, in particular if
force majeure or other circumstances beyond the Hotel’s control render the fulfilment of the Contract impossible;
rooms are reserved with culpably misleading or false information or concealment regarding essential facts; the identity or
solvency of the Customer or the purpose of the Customer’s stay can constitute essential facts;
the Hotel has justified cause to believe that use of the Hotel’s services might jeopardize the smooth operation, the security or
the public reputation of the Hotel, without being attributable to the Hotel’s sphere of control;
the purpose or the occasion of the stay is illegal;
there is a breach of the above-mentioned No. 4.1.£
The justified withdrawal by the Hotel constitutes no claim for damages for the Customer.£
Unless stipulated otherwise in this No. 10, the Hotel is only liable for damages caused with intent or gross negligence. For damages
due to slight negligence, the Hotel is only liable when the damages have been caused by harm inflicted on life, limb or physical health, and
in case of damages due to violation of essential contractual obligations of the Hotel. In the latter case, the liability is limited to the
foreseeable, typically occurring damage. A breach of obligation of the Hotel is deemed to be the equivalent to a breach of a statutory
representative or vicarious agent.£
The Hotel is liable to the Customer for property brought into the Hotel in accordance with the statutory provisions. The Hotel
recommends the use of the safe at the Hotel reception. If the guest wishes to bring money, securities and valuables with a value of more
than €800 or other items with a value of more than €3’500 into the Hotel, a separate safekeeping agreement with the Hotel is necessary.
Insofar as a parking space is provided to the Customer in the Hotel garage or a Hotel parking lot, this does not constitute a
safekeeping agreement, even if a fee is charged. The Hotel only assumes liability pursuant to the preceding No. 10.1 for loss of or damage
to motor vehicles parked or maneuvered on the Hotel’s property, as well as for loss of or damage to its contents.£
Wake-up calls are carried out by the Hotel with the greatest possible diligence. Messages, mail and deliveries for guests are handled
with care. The Hotel delivers, stores, and – on request and against payment – forwards such items. The Hotel only assumes liability hereby
according to the pre-ceding No. 10.1.£
Upon knowledge or prompt objection by the Customer, the Hotel will act to remedy possible disruptions or defects in its performance.
The Customer is obliged to undertake reasonable actions in order to remedy the disruption and to keep a possible damage to a minimum.£
Smoking (including e-cigarettes or similar) in a non-smoking room is prohibited. Smoking (included e-cigarettes or similar) is also not
permitted in the public areas of the hotel. Violation of this no-smoking policy entitles the hotel to terminate the contract without notice. In any
case the hotel will invoice any costs for special cleaning of the hotel room in the amount of EUR 150.00 to the customer.£
The hotel rooms are fitted with sensitive automated smoke alarms. If smoking in the hotel room or public areas causes an activation of
the automatic fire alarm, resulting in an intervention by the police and the fire brigade, the customer shall bear any costs incurred, however
at least EUR 800.£
Dogs may only be kept after obtaining prior written consent from the hotel. The costs for keeping dogs are not included in the room
rate. The customer shall also bear any costs incurred for extra or special cleaning, e.g. soiling or damage, as a result of keeping a
dog/dogs. Other pets than dogs are not allowed.£
In case any furnishing and/or fixtures (e.g. furniture, built-in furniture, floor coverings, etc.) and/or other items and materials used and
provided in the hotel rooms and the hotel building (e.g. pillows, duvets, mattresses, towels, etc.) will be damaged or soiled beyond the
usual measure, the customer will bear the costs for renewal, replacement and/or repair in any case. 12 TECHNICAL INSTALLATIONS, CONNECTIONS AND INTERNET USE
The customer is not permitted to carry out any illegal file sharing using the internet connection provided by the hotel. This includes, in
particular, any uploading or downloading of copyrighted text, music, film or software files. The customer shall be liable for all damages
suffered by the hotel and/or the copyright holder for the violation.£
The hotel gives no guarantee for the actual availability, suitability or reliability of the internet connection for any purpose. Furthermore,
the hotel is not liable for any damages to the Customer’s PC, tablet, smartphone etc. resulting from the use of the internet. In particular, the
hotel is not liable for the contents of any websites called up or any downloaded files. Furthermore, no liability will be assumed for any
viruses caused by use of the internet. The customer shall use the internet at his own risk.£
All claims against the Hotel shall generally prescribe one year after the commencement of the statutory limitation period.
The reduction of the statutory limitation period in No. 11.1 does neither apply to damage claims, nor to claims which are based on an
intentional or grossly negligent breach of obligation by the Hotel.£
You can find more detailed information about the handling of your personal data in our “Privacy Notice for Guests”, which is available
at the Reception.£
In compliance with its statutory obligation the hotel points out that the European Union has set up an online platform for the
extrajudicial resolution of consumer disputes (“ODR platform”): http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/£
The hotel does not, however, participate in dispute resolution proceedings held before consumer dispute resolution bodies.
Parcels and other postal or mail items are accepted by the hotel only if they are addressed to an overnight guest or to an event known
to the hotel and are pre-registered for an overnight stay or an event or have already arrived at the hotel.£
However, these parcel or letter and postal consignments will only be accepted if they have been registered in good time by the
consignor. Unregistered parcel or letter and mail items, as well as not clearly addressed items (for example missing guest or event name)

Amendments and supplements to the Contract or to the acceptance of offers or to these General Terms and Conditions should be
made in writing. Unilateral amendments or supplements by the Customer are invalid.£
In commercial transactions, the place of performance and payment is the place where the particular Hotel is located. In commercial
transactions, as well as when the Customer lacks a place of general jurisdiction within the country according to Section 38, paragraph 2 of
the German Code of Civil Procedure (ZPO), the courts at the seat of the Operating Company shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all disputes
arising out of or in connection with the Contract or these General Terms and Conditions, including in disputes concerning checks and bills
of exchange.£
The Contract and these General Terms and Conditions are governed exclusively by German substantive law, without the application
of its conflict of law’s provisions. The application of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is precluded.

Hotel2Stay does not offer permanent accommodation. Hotel2Stay offers a maximum stay of 6
months within a 18 month period. This means that if a booking is made for 6 months, then the
next 12 months there are now bookings allowed for an Extended Stay.£
Any bookings that exceed 6 consecutive months will be terminated and the Guest needs to
leave the hotel immediately. Payments that are made in advance will be returned. The deposit
will not be repaid.£
In case the personal details of the Guest have (deliberately) been altered in order to exceed the
maximum length of stay the payment obligation for the Guest towards Hotel2Stay for the
agreed term will continue unabridged.£
Hotel2Stay is entitled to cancel a hotel booking if a Guest has not registered by 3 p.m.
(15:00hrs) on the first day of the period covered by the Reservation. This provision will not
apply if the Guest has already paid, or guaranteed payment, for the period covered by the
booking. This clause does not apply to Extended Stay Bookings in case the Guest paid for the
first month.£
 An Extended Stay Booking becomes final after Hotel2Stay has received the full payment for the
first month of rental and the deposit of €300,-. From this moment the Guest and/or its
Guarantor enters into a binding Hotel Agreement with Hotel2Stay.£
The Hotel Agreement may be cancelled by the Guest during its term in accordance with the
cancellation policy as set out in this chapter.£
 A one   month prior notice of cancellation/ replacement booking is applicable. The Guest is
allowed to find a replacement for the remaining period of the Hotel Agreement. The proposed
cancellation and notice of replacement must be provided by email to info@hotel2stay.nl. The
Guest shall derive no rights from the proposal.£

cancellation costs will be 100% of the contracted and unpaid accommodation fee for the
calendar month following the receipt of the cancellation email.£
Hotel2Stay has the right to terminate its services towards the Guest in case of violation of the

Hotel2Stay may require the Guest to pay a deposit of €300,- as a security for unpaid invoices
or as compensation for damages caused by the Guest and/or any outstanding fines. Hotel2Stay

 Within 48 hours after arrival the Guest is obliged to perform a room inventory check. Any
missing or damaged items must be indicated by the Guest to Hotel2Stay.£
 Prior to the check out of the Guest, Hotel2Stay will perform a room inventory check. All
reported damages and missing items that were not reported by the Guest with the room
inventory check at arrival of the Guest will be charged to the Guest.£
 Hotel2Stay will return the deposit to the Guest and/or Contracting Party after check-out of the
Guest.£
 Any outstanding payments and charges will be deducted from the deposit.£
 The deposit will be paid to guest from which it was transferred to Hotel2Stay. If this account is
no longer active the Guest must request transfer to another account in writing prior to its
check-out. Failing to inform Hotel2Stay before check-out will delay the deposit return.
 Hotel2Stay will transfer the deposit within 4-6 weeks after check-out of the Guest.£
 If Hotel2Stay has made the deposit payment and the money transfer was refused because the
account or credit card it was paid to is closed, expired or blocked the deposit transfer will be
delayed. Furthermore Hotel2Stay will deduct an administrative charge of € 25,- from the
deposit for making a new transfer.£
 In case the bank account or credit card to which the deposit payment was made is no longer
assigned to The Guest or The Contracting Party and has already been issued to another person
or entity and Hotel2Stay has not been informed about this beforehand, Hotel2Stay can only
pay out the deposit after the initial transfer has been returned by the new account or credit
card holder.£
Guests are entirely responsible for the conduct and behaviour of the people they bring into
Hotel2Stay and will be liable for any damages or costs of the person(s) accompanying the
Guest.£

perform the Hotel Agreement results from a circumstance that cannot be attributed to
Hotel2Stay, including but not limited to labour strikes, fires, business disruptions or
governmental actions. Hotel2Stay also accept no liability for any harm or loss caused by
persons or property that a Guest has brought into the hotel or caused to be brought into the
hotel.£
 The Contracting Party and the Guest are liable for all claims that Hotel2Stay has and/or come
to have against them.£
 Hotel2Stay’s liability will never exceed the value of the Hotel Agreement or payment for the
harm or loss covered by the insurance company or the amount in compensation for the harm
or loss another third party pays to Hotel2Stay. Hotel2Stay will send a statement of the current
insurances in effect upon the Guests request.£
 If harm or loss occurs as a result of the culpable failure to perform on the part of a third party
whose services we have engaged, such as a security or cleaning company, then the Guest’s
compensation will be limited to the compensation Hotel2Stay receives from the relevant third
party.£
 Hotel2Stay takes measures to ensure the security of the hotel accommodation. Should an
incident (such as theft or vandalism) occur that is directly attributable to the failure of the
security service, the Guest or Contracting Party will receive the payment that Hotel2Stay has
demanded from the security service on duty at the time of the specific incident.£
 If property is removed, stolen or damaged, the Guest must prove that the loss or damage to
the property occurred in the hotel accommodation as a result of the acts or omissions on the
part of the third party whose services we have engaged.£
 Except as set out in the clause above, Hotel2Stay accept no liability for any harm or loss
caused in respect of any persons and/or their property, including death, personal injury,
property damage or theft.£
 We are not liable to the Guest for a harm or loss that occurs as a result of or in connection
with the performance of any agreement between Hotel2Stay and the Contracting Party and/or
Guest if the Contracting Party and/or Guest is insured, or could have been insured, against the
relevant harm or loss.£
 With due observance of the foregoing, Hotel2Stay will be liable for the harm or loss of goods
that the Guest has placed in our custody in exchange for a fee. The damages will be limited to
the current market value of the goods in question. Hotel2Stay will not be liable for the
contents of these goods. A wallet will be covered but the contents of that wallet will not be
covered unless we were given a written statement of the contents at the time it was placed in
our custody. We expressly exclude liability for any other form of harm or loss, including
consequential harm or loss.£
 We shall never accept any liability for any goods placed in our custody or left with us in any
way – regardless of how that arrangement was arrived at or who placed the goods in our
custody or left the goods with us – unless we have charged a fee for the arrangement.
 We will not accept liability of lost luggage, personal items, mail or delivered packages unless
the guest can prove that these items were lost or stolen due to the Hotel or its staff’s
negligence.£
The Guest or those accompanying the Guest are jointly liable for all harm or loss that has been
and/or will be inflicted upon Hotel2Stay and/or any third party as the direct or indirect
consequence of misconduct, negligence and/or a wrongful act instigated by a Guest and those
accompanying Guest.£
 This liability also applies in respect of violations of the House Rules instigated by the Guest
and those accompanying the Guest.£
 This liability also applies in respect of harm or loss caused by any animals and/or any
substance and/or any property held by or under the supervision of the Guest and those
accompanying the Guest.£
 Hotel2Stay may file an official report with the local police if we observe misconduct, criminal
acts or violations of the Terms & Conditions and/ or House rules.£
Hotel2Stay does not charge city tax to Guests with an Extended Stay contract because
registration as a resident of the city where the hotel is located is mandatory with this type of
Hotel Booking. The Guest has to be able to provide Hotel2Stay with a copy of his/her
registration with the city within 3 weeks after check-in. If the Guest cannot provide this proof
of registration Hotel2Stay will charge city tax over the full stay and if necessary deduct it from
the deposit.£
 Guests are not allowed to apply for housing benefit for their room at Hotel2Stay. Hotel2Stay

for exclusive or common use, without distinction.£
These Regulations are available to clients at the hotel reception and they may
consult them whenever they wish. Additionally, these Regulations are available on the
hotel’s website.£
Ignorance of these Regulations is no defence for non-compliance, as these
Regulations are based on current laws and legislation.£
These Regulations will be in continuous and uninterrupted effect until they are

satisfactory in all its rules and regulations.£

immediately and, if appropriate, may be punished in accordance with labour, civil or
criminal legislation, irrespective of other responsibilities that the offender may incur and
the appropriate legal action to which they are entitled.£
The Hotel reserves the right of admission and to cancel the reservation, without
right to refund, of any client who contravenes these Regulations, as well as the rules of
living and common sense, or acts in any way disrespectfully to the Hotel facilities or other
people within it, be they staff or guests of the Hotel.£
We appreciate your choice to stay with us, as well as your strict observance of our
Regulations, prepared for your own benefit.£
In any case, should you require additional information please do not hesitate to
contact Reception. To this end, we remind you that the Hotel Manager, together with
the reception staff and, where appropriate, the concierge, are the main contact or
central relationship for guests of the hotel establishment, and for information and advice
of the same.£
The Internal Regimen Regulation is governed by Spanish law.£
This Regulation is available in different languages, but only the text in Spanish is
the sole legally binding text, and the one that will prevail if there is any difference of
interpretation or any other nature.£
Reception is where the necessary steps are taken for registration and admission,
and where the magnetic cards are kept to access accommodation.£
Check-in takes place from 14:00 and until 20:00 on the day of the client's arrival,
and Check-out until 12.00 pm on the day of departure.£
If the guest arrives before Check-in time and the Hotel has rooms available, they
can enter as early as 7:00.£
In the event that, for personal reasons, the guest has to register their arrival after
20:00, they should notify the hotel 24 hours prior to their arrival.£
The Hotel will abstain from providing accommodation to minors who arrive alone,
nor do we accept bookings of rooms or stays by minors.£
However, minors between the ages of 16 to 18 years old may be authorised in
writing by the father, mother or guardian to stay at the Hotel as long as they are the ones
to take responsibility of the minor and assume the payment of the bill as appropriate. In
the case of minors under the age of 16 years, they must also always be accompanied
by the father, mother or guardian.£
The person or persons who wish to make use of the accommodation units,
common facilities and, where appropriate, complementary services offered by the
Hotel, must present their identification documents on registration and sign in to the Hotel
Register of the establishment.£
When guests arrive as a pre-booked group (group bookings are considered
reservations of 10 or more rooms), their representative will hand over the lists together
with the identification documents of the group members.£
Valid identification in Spain are passports, DNI and Driver's License. If you are a
foreigner you can register by presenting a Passport or Identity Card if you come from an
EU country or any of the following countries:£
  Andorra, Iceland, Switzerland, Norway, Malta, Monaco or San Marino.
You can also register with a current Spanish Residency Permit if you are a foreign
resident in Spain.£
This rule is mandatory in accordance with the Order of the Ministry of the Interior
of the Government of Spain 1922/2.003 of 3 July, which requires registration and entry
records for Travellers in a Hotel Establishment, Royal Decree 933/2021 of October 26 and
under the provisions of article 12.1 of Organic Law 1/1992, of February 21, on the
Protection of Citizen Security.£
In compliance with the above, all guests, both individuals and guests, must have
an individual registration sheet.£
The registration sheet must be personally signed by all travellers over the age of
14 years.£
The accommodation is non-transferable, meaning that the Hotel will deny
accommodation to any guest who does not comply with this registration requirement
and has the power to demand, if it deems it appropriate, the identification of the
applicant and the people accompanying them in the hotel. Any person not registered
in the police register are also prohibited from entering the Hotel, unless with the direct
permission of the Management.£
The Hotel Management is not responsible for any false or incomplete information
that the guest may provide when filling out the registration card, whose details should be
filled out by the user in full, or by the Hotel based on the details that appear on the
identification documents provided to such effects by the client.£
In compliance with current legislations, the identification data supplied shall be
communicated to the authorities by the Hotel.£
This establishment, once a person or persons have been registered, will prepare
an admission document stating the name of the client in order to formalise the admission
(featuring a person, the commercial name of the establishment, the tourist classification,
the identification of the allocated accommodation, price per day, the category and
price of complementary services provided, and dates of check-in and check-out).£
Users must provide proof of their condition, producing the admission document,
when required.£
The admission sheet provides proof of the tourist accommodation contract and
will serve as proof for administrative purposes, and therefore must be signed by the
concerned party to formalise their admission.£
The original signed document shall remain in the possession of the establishment,
who will retain it for the time stipulated by law to be made available for tourist inspection,
providing a copy to the guest who signed the same.£
By signing the document, the client confirms that all the data provided are true
and accepts the terms and conditions expressed in the document.£
Signing the document also assumes that the Client expressly accepts these
Regulations, its rights and obligations, and shall be bound to observe the rules contained
in the same and those dictated by Management on security, coexistence and hygiene
for the proper use of the establishment, its facilities and the equipment of the Hotel.£
Users may freely access the establishment and stay in the same, within the
limitations contained in legislation and in these Regulations.£
Users have the right to receive full and accurate information, and for such
information to be provided prior to the contracting of services offered.£
In addition, guests have the right to security, privacy and total peace-of-mind
during their stay, in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions. Invoices for any
services contracted directly to the hotel will be issued to in accordance with the current
regulations of the Data Protection Act concerning maintaining the confidentiality of any
personal information. In the event of a guest wishing to make a complaint, forms
provided by the relevant authoritative department(s) from the corresponding
Autonomous Community (region) must be filled out by the guest and handed in at the
hotel reception.£
The submission of any claim or complaint does not exempt the client from the
observance of these Regulations or the payment of services.£
The hotel is not responsible for the price, nor the use of tools, utensils and other
services provided outside the hotel establishment, nor the behaviour of any outside staff,
unless expressly reflected in their conditions and rates.£
Rates with the prices and conditions of the different modes of accommodation,
catering, bars, safe rental, and complementary services offered by the Hotel are detailed
in reception for users who request them.£
It is not possible to reserve services of the establishment or accommodation units
against the stipulated price.£
Complementary services that are offered and are provided in this establishment
by other persons or entities, the detail of their scheduled times, their prices and conditions
of use, also found at reception, will be formalised in their corresponding documents and
settled in accordance with the conditions agreed.£
Legal entities or individuals who, on their own basis, provide complementary
services in different areas of the hotel, are responsible for their own staff and their
behaviour, operation, maintenance, prices and everything inherent in their own services.
Each of the different units clearly identifies the holder of the same.£
For all of the services and activities, where appropriate, you will find a summary of
information in directories, which include information about the evacuation plan in case
of emergency, accommodation prices, menus with their prices, and communication of
free services, such as Wi-Fi.£
In any case, the Hotel can offer to their clients, at no additional cost, extra services
such as tourist information, wake up service, storage of valuables in the Hotel's general
safe, provided that their contents is declared and signed for by the customer, storage of
baggage, and taxi calling service.£
The Hotel is also able to manage certain services beyond the establishment, such
as car rental, excursions, restaurants, and other services related to the stay.£
The Hotel may vary the timetables for different services of consumption, use and
enjoyment, throughout the seasons, depending on the seasonality, and reserves the right
not to admit users outside these hours, or when the maximum authorised capacity is
exceeded or admission is limited, thereby damaging the work schedules of such services.
Guests’ permission will be sought prior to taking any messages, phone calls,
packages or anything addressed to them on their behalf. In the event that the guest
cannot be located within the hotel, staff will ensure that the message or package is
verified with the guest upon their return and delivered to them appropriately.£
The rooms and common spaces of the hotel may not be used for uses other than
accommodation and/or hired services, either by the guest or his/her companions, or by
third parties. Consequently, the aforementioned rooms and/or common spaces may not
be used for activities such as conducting interviews, filming, taking pictures for
promotional activities, photo sessions, etc., unless previously and expressly authorized by
the Management of the establishment and always complying with the rest of Internal
Regulations, the conditions set by the aforementioned Management and the regulations
that apply to the activity in question.£
The billing of accommodation rates will be computed per day and in accordance
with the number of overnight stays.£
The minimum billing for accommodation will be at the rate of one overnight or
day, with the understanding that this ends at 12:00 the day after the date of entry.
Payment methods accepted by the Hotel are the following: Cash, Debit cards
(Maestro) and Credit cards (Master Card, Visa, Amex, American Express and Diners).£
Personal cheques are not accepted.£
When payment is made in cash, this must be done in euros.£
The payment may not exceed the amount of 1,000 euros and, given that the rights
must be exercised in accordance with the requirements of good faith, bills must be used
that are appropriate to the amount to pay, meaning that the Hotel reserves the right to
refuse high denomination bills if the amount to be paid is much lower.£
Payments with more than 50 coins of euros will also not be accepted.£
Users are obligated to pay the amount of contracted services when presented
with the bill or in accordance with the agreed terms.£
Any food or other goods found in the Hotel room (for example the contents of the
minibar, towel, bathrobe), which you consume or take with you when leaving the room
will be charged the equivalent amount as shown on the price list available in each room
or in the Hotel reception.£
In the event that a Client leaves their room and said food or goods are not found
in the room, it shall be deemed that these were consumed or taken by the client.£
The bill can be presented by the Hotel before the end of the stay if during this
period the services enjoyed (either accommodation, extras or both) meet or exceed the
sum of 600 euros.£
The establishment may require its clients, at any time and after the presentation
of the bill and its receipt, to pay for of services provided outside the accommodation,
even when the payment for this had been agreed in advance.£
The departure of the client before the end of the contracted stay shall not exempt
the client from paying the full amount for all reserved days and contracted services.
If a client intends to leave the establishment with a wholly or partially unpaid bill,
the Hotel will be entitled to request the assistance of the authorities.£
The Hotel can request advance of payment by credit card for the contracted
services, in accordance with the applicable law, of both the full amount of the
reservation including taxes and tourist tax that may apply, as well as for extras.£
This guarantee may be extended to damages or malfunctions that occur in the
fixtures, furniture or other elements of the establishment due to negligence or misuse.£
To such effects, the Hotel can ask the client on arrival, or when making their
reservation, for a credit card number where, in the case of non-payment of a bill, they
can be charged for the same.£
Such a request may be made even for accommodation that is pre-paid or
comped, to ensure payment for extra services that may be used, as well as to cover
damages and malfunctions.£
The Hotel reserves the right, in the event of any damages, malfunction or theft in
the room or any other area of the hotel by the customer, to use the breakage deposit
and/or claim this compensation.£
The Hotel will also be able to use the client’s credit card number to charge or
preauthorise the amount of the first night contracted, even days before the client's
arrival, in order to verify the validity of the card.£
If a card cannot be provided, prepayment for the stay and a security deposit of
500 euros will be required, as well as upfront payment for any extra services requested.
Hotel rooms should be used based on the number of nights booked.£
Occupation of an accommodation unit begins at 12:00 noon on the first day of
the contracted period and ends at 12:00 noon on the day indicated as the date of
departure.£
However, on dates of maximum occupancy, when there is a higher number of
check-ins and check-outs, it is possible that not all rooms will be available at this schedule
due to reasons of availability and cleaning times, which can lead to a delay of up to four
hours in making the accommodation unit available to the user.£
Availability may also be delayed in the case of exceptional circumstances which
prevent, for reasons beyond the Hotel’s capabilities, having the room for the
corresponding guest at the time fixed for the beginning of the occupation under the
normal rules of occupation.£
We ask that the guest communicates their time of arrival and travel plans to
enable the Hotel to prepare, and also remember that if you do not arrive at the hotel by
20:00 hours (local time) on the day of your arrival, without prior communication from the
guest, the Hotel will consider the reservation as a “no show” and it will be fully cancelled
automatically, charging 100% or the outstanding amount of the reservation.£
However, the reservation will be kept as long as the client has communicated their
arrival before the time mentioned above.£
In the case of groups of 20 or more persons, the establishment may set the
departure time from 10 in the morning.£
For possible changes, both in occupation as well as an extension of the time
indicated, please ask at reception, keeping in mind that you must immediately inform
Hotel staff should you want to prolong your stay, and always before 12 noon of the
departure date.£
The Hotel will honour your request as long as availability permits, duly informing the
guest who requested it, and in the case of agreement between the parties, they may
agree to a new occupancy status of the accommodation units, which should be
reflected in the admission document.£
Any extension of the time of occupation to that described, without prior
agreement, will result in the obligation to pay for one day more.£
Notwithstanding the above, the client will not be able to extend, without
agreement from the Hotel, the contracted number of days of stay, due to the serious
damage that this could cause for other clients with reservations. The Hotel staff has the
power to request help from the authority to evict clients who fail to comply with the
above.£
In the event that the client leaves the room on the day of departure prior to the
time set for the Check-Out, there will be no refund for the total amount of the stay. If the
client reduces, in whole or in part, the number of guests on the reservation, it is the Hotel's
decision whether or not to grant a refund, though in the case that the room has been
indicated as non-refundable or similar, there will be a charge of the full amount of the
booking.£
When guests are absent for more than seventy-two hours without prior notice, the
Hotel may deem the contract of accommodation to be suspended or terminated, and
proceed to collect the luggage in accordance with article 18 of these Regulations,
except in the case in which the actual value of the guest's belongings does not
guarantee the amount of the bill.£
Under these circumstances the Hotel may terminate or suspend the stay with the
absence of the guest for more than twenty-four hours. In the event of the death of the
occupant of a room, their heirs or representatives will be responsible for paying the
resulting costs, including if necessary the redecoration and disinfection of the room and
the replacement of linens and equipment.£
As a general rule, persons who exceed the contracted room capacity are not
permitted to stay.£
Consequently, two people will not be permitted to stay in a double room that has
been contracted as a single. Similarly, no more than two people will be allowed to stay
in a double room or suite, nor more than three in a room booked as a triple.£
For safety reasons a maximum of four people are allowed to a room, or where
appropriate, the maximum number according to the room format and type of
reservation.£
Otherwise, the Hotel reserves the right to charge the fixed rate for the actual
number of persons using the room, and at the same time put an immediate end to the
client’s stay.£
Guests staying with infants of 0 to 2 years old may request, subject to availability,
a baby cot at no additional cost. The maximum number of baby cots in a room is one.£
Bedside cots are available on request and must be confirmed by the accommodation.£
One child aged 2 or over or one adult can stay in an extra bed. The use of an
additional or rollaway bed will carry an additional cost and be available only in double
rooms, and always at the request of the individual user. In the event that the bed has not
been requested in advance, the Hotel reserves the right to request an extra reservation
in the event that the establishment does not have the requested extra bed. Such
additional bed can only be occupied by one person, one being the maximum number
of extra beds in the room.£
No person has the right to give accommodation to another without the prior
consent of the hotel, and if this is given, their movements must be recorded in the Hotel
Register.£
The Hotel reserves the right to admit occasional visitors and under no
circumstances will they be allowed access to the rooms. If the user wishes to receive visits,
the Hotel has spaces available for this purpose.£
Should a user fail to comply, the Hotel Management reserves the right to order the
immediate departure of the visitor.£"
;"Accommodation Agreements become effective when the Hotel approves the request described in Article 2 above. However, this
will not apply if it is proved that the Hotel did not approve the request.£
When Accommodation Agreements become effective as described in Paragraph 1 above, Guests, by the payment method Hotel
specifies, shall pay the Hotel an amount not exceeding the basic accommodation fee for the requested dates of stay by the date
Hotel specifies.£
Firstly, the request fee described in Paragraph 2 above will be applied to final accommodation fee that Guests are required to pay.
Secondly, in the event of any of the conditions described in Articles 7 and 19 below, such request fee will be applied to cancellation
fee and then to compensation. Thirdly, if there is any balance remaining, it will be returned to Guests’ credit card when Guests
made payments by credit card and to bank accounts that Guests designate when Guests made payments by other means.£
If Guests do not pay the request fee described and as stipulated in Paragraph 2 above, by the payment due date specified by the
Hotel, their reservation becomes immediately null and void, provided that the Hotel has notified them of the payment due date in
advance.£
Notwithstanding Article 3 Paragraph 2 above, after entering Accommodation Agreements, the Hotel may in some cases offer a
special agreement in which payment of the request fee will not be required.£
If the Hotel did not request payment of the request fee described in Article 3 Paragraph 2 above when accepting the request for
Accommodation Agreements, or did not specify a payment due date, Accommodation Agreements will be treated as a special
agreement as described in Paragraph 1 above.£
Guests will not let others stay at the Hotel, assign or resale Accommodation Agreements, or let others use Hotel’s facilities for
Guests only without the Hotel's prior written consent.£
Before the date of stay, the Hotel may contact Guests through the contact information provided based on Article 2 Paragraph 1

of the booking order or a completion of a registration card is enough to comply with the form
requirement.£
Rights and obligations of the contractual parties that are not expressly regulated by the
accommodation contract are covered by these Accommodation Rules and the price list of services

and the enclosed Accommodation Rules and / or the price list of the Lodging Provider, or
otherwise violates good manners of the Hotel (hereinafter referred to as “Misconduct”), the
Lodging Provider is entitled to terminate the accommodation contract before the expiration of the
agreed period, even without notice period, if the Guest was warned about his / her Misconduct by

The accommodated is obliged to reserve the accommodation with the Lodging Provider in written
form or make a reservation by phone and confirm this reservation to the Lodging Provider in

Guest a fine in the amount determined by the Hotel for an in-depth sanitation, or for a settlement
of a claim caused by the above-mentioned activities.£
Responsibility of the Lodging Provider for things of an accommodated person
If the Guest asks for it, the Lodging Provider deposits their cash, jewelry or other valuables. The
Hotel has the right to refuse deposit of the things that are dangerous, or their value and scope are
disproportionate for the accommodation premise. These are mainly cash or items (e.g. jewelry
and other valuables) whose value exceeds CZK 50,000. The Provider requires that the items to be
put in the safe deposit be handed in a closed or sealed container.£
Hotel rooms are not intended for safe keeping of valuables and cash, the Lodging Provider
provides a safety deposit box in hotel rooms and reception for such purposes.£
Damages caused to the property of the accommodated may be claimed only within 15 days after
finding out of the damage. Damage will not be paid if the Guest or the person accompanying them
caused the damage.£
If the Guest leaves their stuff in a room after the end of the stay and the accommodation is not
paid, the Lodging Provider moves the stuff away from the room and stores it in a safe place to
prevent damage. After the payment of the accommodation debt, the Provider hands the items over
to the Guest.£
The Guest is obliged to read safety regulations and the evacuation plan in case of a fire. This plan
can be found in each hotel room and can is kept at the reception and its employees.
The Guest should behave in such a way that there is no unreasonable detriment to freedom, life,
health or property of another person.£

covered by the paid deposit in accordance with Article 4, par. 4.5 of the Accommodation Rules.£
If the value of the damage is higher than the deposit, the Guest is obliged to pay this difference to
the Provider.£

§2945 et seq. Act No. 89/2012 Coll. of the Civil Code.£

the price of accommodation per 1 day. The rest follows the regulation §2946 et seq. Act No.
89/2012 Coll. of the Civil Code£

damage caused to means of transport and to things left in them unless the Provider expressly
declares that it has taken such things into safekeeping.£

;"General Terms and Conditions of 25hours Hotels in Germany
(excluding 25hours Hotel Hamburg Number One) for Hotel
Accommodation and Events (last update: March 2018)
These Terms and Conditions apply to all contracts
concerning
the renting of hotel rooms for accommodation as
well as all services rendered for guests in this
connection (hereinafter referred to as ‘Hotel
Accommodation Contract’) by the 25hours hotel in
question (hereinafter referred to as ‘Hotel’). The
term ‘Hotel Accommodation Contract’ embraces
and replaces the following terms: accommodation
contract, guest accommodation contract, hotel
contract and hotel room contract;  the renting of Hotel conference, banquet and
event rooms for the holding of events such as
banquets, seminars, conferences, exhibitions and
presentations, etc., as well as all Hotel services
rendered for guests in this connection.£
The subletting or onward letting of rented rooms,
premises, spaces or display cases, as well as public
invitations and the holding of sales or similar events,
requires the Hotel’s prior written consent, to the
exclusion, unless the guest is a consumer, of Section
540 paragraph 1 sentence 2 of the German Civil Code
(Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch ~ BGB).£
These Terms and Conditions apply exclusively. Any
contrary or divergent terms and conditions will not be
recognised unless they are expressly agreed in
advance and in writing. Any special contractual
agreements between the Hotel and the guest take
precedence.£
The Contract enters into force on acceptance of the
guest’s request by the Hotel. The Hotel is entitled to
confirm the booking of a room or event in writing or by
e-mail.£
The Contracting Parties are the Hotel and the guest for
whom the Hotel is providing the services. If a third
party makes the order on the guest’s behalf it is jointly
and severally liable to the Hotel together with the guest
for all obligations arising from the Contract in question.
The Hotel undertakes to reserve the rooms booked by
the guest and to provide the services requested by
the guest and promised by the Hotel, as well as any
services individually agreed with the guest. Unless
otherwise agreed, the guest is not entitled to a
specific room or, in the case of events, to a room
which has already been allocated on organisational
grounds.£
The guest undertakes to pay either the prevailing
price charged by the Hotel for the rooms and any
other services, or the price agreed with the Hotel if
different. This also applies to services outsourced by
the Hotel to third parties, whether these are procured
directly by the guest or obtained via the Hotel. This
applies in particular to the claims of copyright
associations.£
The agreed prices are inclusive of the taxes and local
levies prevailing at the time of concluding the
Contract. Not included are local levies payable by the
guests themselves in line with local ordinances, for
instance tourist tax. In the event of changes to the
rate of VAT or the introduction, changing or abolition
of local levies on the service in question after
conclusion of the contract, the prices will be adjusted
accordingly. However, in the case of contracts with
consumers this only applies if the period between
conclusion and fulfilment of the contract exceeds
four months.£
On concluding a contract with a guest the Hotel is
entitled to charge a reasonable advance payment or
to demand security, for instance in the form of a
credit card guarantee. The amount of the advance
payment and the payment dates may be agreed in
writing in the Contract. In the case of stays
exceeding one week or bills for more than EUR 1,000
for services already rendered the Hotel is entitled to
issue interim invoices which are payable immediately.
In justified cases, for example in the event of a guest
falling into arrears or the broadening of the
Contract’s scope, in conformity with subsection III. 4
the Hotel is entitled, between conclusion of the
Contract and the start of the guest’s stay and/or the
start of the event, to increase the advance payment
or guarantee agreed in the Contract by any amount
up to the full agreed remuneration.£
Furthermore, at the beginning and during a guest’s
stay the Hotel is entitled to charge a reasonable
advance payment or demand security in conformity
with subsection III.4 above on existing and future
claims arising from the Contract if said advance
payment or security has not already been furnished
by the guest in accordance with subsection III. 4
above and/or subsection III.5? below.£
If, after making a booking, a guest subsequently
wishes to reduce the number of rooms booked, the
services required or the duration of the stay, the
Hotel may make its agreement to said reduction
subject to an increase in the charge it makes for the
remaining rooms and/or services which it does
provide.£
The total invoice amount in connection with a Hotel
Accommodation Contract is payable by the guest at
the latest on departure. Any advance payments
requested by the Hotel must be made no later than
the date specified by the Hotel.£
Other Hotel invoices with no due date are payable in
full within ten days of receipt. The Hotel may at any
time demand the immediate payment by guests of
claims which are already due.£
If a guest falls into payment arrears guest the Hotel is
entitled to charge the prevailing statutory rate of
penal interest, which is currently the central bank
base rate plus 8%, or in the case of transactions
involving consumers 5%. However, irrespective of
this the Hotel reserves the right to prove that it has
suffered greater loss or damage. Furthermore, in
this event the Hotel is entitled to refuse to render any
further or future services for the guest provided it
has given the guest prior warning and set a period for
payment of the arrears, in the process warning the
guest that it would refuse to render any further
services if said payment is not made within the
stipulated period.£
In every individual case the Hotel is entitled to
choose whether or not to accept credit cards and
which credit cards it is willing to accept, even if its
general acceptance of credit cards is advertised on
signs displayed in the Hotel. Cheques, credit cards
and other means of payment are accepted only in
consideration of performance.£
The guest may only offset its own claims against the
Hotel’s claims if said claims are undisputed or
established in law.£
If a given individual contract grants the guest a right
of cancellation without charge within a given period,
the Hotel is likewise entitled to cancel the Contract
during that period if other prospective guests make
enquiries about the contractually booked bedrooms
or event rooms and, in response to a corresponding
request by the Hotel, the guest elects not to waive its
cancellation right.£
If an advance payment or security agreed or
demanded pursuant to Section III above is not
made/furnished by the expiry of a reasonable
extension period granted by the Hotel, the Hotel shall
be entitled to cancel the Contract.£
The Hotel is also entitled to cancel the Contract on
legitimate material grounds. A legitimate materiel
ground is deemed to exist if
  force majeure or other circumstances beyond
the Hotel’s control render fulfilment of the
Contract impossible;
  rooms are booked on the basis of misleading or
false information, for instance regarding the
identity of the guest or purpose of the booking;
  events or rooms are culpably booked on the
basis of misleading or false information or the
withholding of material circumstances. These
may concern the guest’s identity or solvency or
the purpose of the stay;
  the Hotel has good reason to belief that
providing its services for the guest in question
could jeopardise the smooth running, safety or
reputation of the Hotel in ways not imputable to
the Hotel’s sphere of control or organisation;
  the purpose of or reason for the stay and/or
event is unlawful;
  the guest allows third parties to use the rooms
without the Hotel’s consent.£
The guest has no right to damages in the event of the
legitimate cancellation of the Contract by the Hotel.
VI. Cancellation of a Hotel Accommodation Contract by
the Guest
The guest is only entitled to cancel a Hotel
Accommodation Contract concluded with the Hotel if
the Contract expressly provides for a right of
cancellation, if there is in any case a statutory right
of cancellation or if the Hotel expressly consents to
the rescission of the Contract. Any agreement to a
right of cancellation or to the rescission of a contract
must be made in writing.£
If the Hotel and the guest agree a deadline after
which the right to cancel the Contract without charge
expires, the guest may cancel the Contract until said
expiry date without triggering any right to payment or
damages on the Hotel’s part. However, the guest’s
right of cancellation is forfeited if it is not exercised
within that period.£
If a right of cancellation has not been agreed or has
already expired, if there is no statutory right of
cancellation or termination or if the Hotel does not
consent to the rescission of the Contract, the Hotel
reserves its right to the agreed remuneration
regardless of whether the guest avails itself of the
agreed services or not. However, [when calculating
the above-mentioned remuneration] the Hotel must
offset any receipts from letting the rooms to others
and also any cost savings [resulting from the
cancellation]. If the rooms are not let to others the
Hotel may make a lump-sum deduction to reflect the
costs saved. In this event the guest is obliged to pay
at least 90% of the contractually agreed charges for
overnight accommodation with or without breakfast
and for arrangements involving third-party services,
as well as 70% for half-board and 60% for full-board
arrangements. However, the guest shall be free to
provide proof that a claim for the above amounts has
not in fact arisen or is excessive.£
The guest is only entitled to cancel an Event Contract
concluded with the Hotel if the Contract expressly
provides for a right of cancellation, if there is in any
case a statutory right of cancellation or if the Hotel
expressly consents to the rescission of the Contract.£
Any agreement to a right of cancellation or to the
rescission of a contract must be made in writing.£
If the Hotel and the guest agree a deadline after
which the right to cancel the Contract without charge
expires, the guest may cancel the Contract until said
expiry date without triggering any right to payment or
damages on the Hotel’s part. However, the guest’s
right of cancellation is forfeited if it is not exercised
within that period.£
If a right of cancellation has not been agreed or has
already expired, if there is no statutory right of
cancellation or termination or if the Hotel does not
consent to the rescission of the Contract, the Hotel
reserves its right to the agreed remuneration
regardless of whether the guest avails itself of the
agreed services or not. However, [when calculating
the above-mentioned remuneration] the Hotel must
offset any receipts from alternative use of the rooms
and also any cost savings [resulting from the
cancellation]. Said saved expenses will be taken into
account via the following compensation
arrangements:
The guest is obliged to pay compensation if it cancels
within 84 days of the agreed event date. The
following cancellation fees will be payable:
- 42-83 days before the start of the event 50%...
- 14-41 days before the start of the event 75%...
- 1-13 days before the start of the event 90%...
... of either the agreed price or the price for the
arranged event as determined by the Hotel’s price
list. If the guest only hires premises, without any
meals or drinks, the remuneration payable will be
90% of the agreed price regardless of the
cancellation date. However, the guest shall be free to
provide proof that a claim for the above amounts has
not in fact arisen or is excessive, whereas the Hotel
shall be free to provide proof that the loss or damage
incurred was in fact greater.£
VIII. Surrender and Return of Bedrooms
Unless expressly agreed the guest is not granted any
entitlement to specific rooms.£
Guests may occupy booked rooms from 3:00 p.m. on
the agreed day of arrival. Unless specially agreed the
guest is not entitled to occupy rooms at an earlier
time.£
Unless a later arrival time has been arranged, the
rooms have been fully paid for in advance or the
guest has given the Hotel a credit card number
whereby the Hotel can charge the room price even if
the guest does not show up, the Hotel shall be entitled
to let the rooms to others from 4 p.m. onwards. In
this event the guest has no right to assert any claim
against the Hotel.£
On the agreed day of departure the guest must vacate
the rooms by 12 noon at the latest. If the guest fails
to vacate rooms on time the Hotel may charge 50% of
the room’s full list price for the following night for
late occupancy between 12 noon and 6 p.m. and
100% thereafter. In this event the guest has no right
to assert any contractual claim against the Hotel.
However, the guest shall be free to provide proof that
a claim for the above amounts has not in fact arisen
or is excessive. The above is without prejudice to the
Hotel’s right to assert claims for more extensive loss
or damage.£
The Hotel is entitled to refuse a guest admittance to
the Hotel or accommodation therein if on the guest’s
arrival it has good grounds for believing that the
guest is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or
otherwise behaves in an offensive manner towards
hotel staff or other guests. The Hotel is entitled to
eject a guest from the Hotel and cancel without
notice its existing Contract with that guest if he or
she repeatedly disturbs the peace or causes a
nuisance for other guests or hotel staff.£
IX. Change of Event Time and Additional Services
If agreed event start and finish times are delayed,
and the Hotel agrees to these changes, the Hotel may
make a reasonable extra charge for services made
available during this period unless the Hotel is
responsible for the delay.£
If the guest requests changes to the agreed type of
seating on the day of the event the Hotel reserves the
right to make a fixed charge of EUR 75 for the
rearrangement work involved.£
The actual number of people at events where food
and drink are served may not be more than 20%
lower than the number stated in the event contract,
regardless of when the number of people was
reduced.£
The guest is obliged to inform the Hotel of the final
number of people at least 5 working days before the
event starts.£
If the number of people increases, the actual number
of people in attendance will be used as the basis for
the invoice.£
If the actual number of people is lower than the final
figure provided, the hotel shall be entitled to bill the
guest the difference between the actual number of
people and the maximum permissible reduction in
full.£
Any costs incurred for services over and above the
agreed ones, such as telephone, bar and mini-bar
drinks and other additional meals and drinks, must be
paid for by the event participants themselves. The
guest is jointly and severally liable for any such costs
together with the event participants.£
The guest may not bring its own food and drink to
events except with the Hotel’s consent. If said
consent is given a charge will be made to cover the
Hotel’s overhead costs in this respect.£
If the Hotel obtains technical and other equipment
from third parties at the guest’s request it does so in
the name, on the authority and on behalf of the guest.
The guest is responsible for handling the equipment
with care and returning it in good condition, and
hereby indemnifies the Hotel against all third-party
claims arising from the provision of said equipment.
The guest must obtain the Hotel’s consent if it
intends to connect its own electrical equipment to the
Hotel’s power network. Any malfunctions or damage
to the Hotel’s technical installations caused by the
use of this equipment will be charged to the guest
unless the Hotel is at fault for said damage. The Hotel
is entitled to make a fixed charge to cover the cost of
the electricity consumed by this equipment.£
With the Hotel’s consent the guest may use its own
telephone, fax and data transmission equipment. The
Hotel may charge a connection fee in this respect.
If the use of the guest’s own equipment means that
suitable Hotel equipment remains unused the Hotel is
entitled to make a corresponding compensation
charge.£
Any malfunctions in technical or other equipment
provided by the Hotel will be repaired as quickly as
possible. However, payments may not be withheld or
reduced unless the Hotel is responsible for said
malfunctions.£
XII. Loss of or Damage to Items Brought by Guests
Any personal items or items brought to the Hotel by
guests for use at events are kept in the event rooms
or the Hotel at the guest’s own risk. The Hotel
disclaims all liability for the loss, destruction or
damage of said items, including for financial loss,
unless this is the result of gross negligence or intent
on the Hotel’s part. Also excluded from the above
disclaimer are loss of life, physical injury and harm to
health, as well as all cases whose individual
circumstances entail that safekeeping constitutes a
contractually-typical obligation.£
Any decorative items brought by guests must comply
with all fire safety requirements. The Hotel is entitled
to demand official proof of compliance, and if such
proof is not forthcoming the Hotel may remove
materials already installed at the guest’s cost. The
guest must consult with the Hotel before putting up or
affixing any items.£
Any items brought for display or other purposes must
be removed immediately at the end of the event. If
the guest fails to do so the Hotel may remove and
store said items at the guest’s cost. If the items are
left in an event room the Hotel may make a
reasonable charge for the use of that room until it
has been made ready for reuse.£
XIII. The Guest’s Liability during Events
If the guest is a business enterprise it is liable for all
damage to buildings, furnishings, fixtures or fittings
caused by event participants, visitors, employees,
other associated third parties or by the guest itself.
The guest hereby indemnifies the Hotel against all
third-party claims arising from the conduct of the
guest, its employees, the event participants or the
guest’s vicarious agents.£
Compensation claims on the part of the customer are
excluded. Exempt from this rule are claims on the
part of the customer for damages due to injury to life,
body and health, or in case of violation of contractual
duties (cardinal obligations), as well as liability for
other damages based on intentional or grossly
negligent breaches of duty committed by the hotel, its
legal representatives or agents.£ Essential contractual
obligations are those which need to be fulfilled in
order to achieve the aim of the contract. In the case
of violation of contractual duties, the hotel shall only
be liable for foreseeable damage typical for the
contract, if such damage was caused by ordinary
negligence, unless the customer claims damages
relating to injury to life, body or health.£ The
aforementioned limitations shall also apply in favour
of the legal representatives and vicarious agents of
the hotel, if claims are made directly against them.
The Hotel is liable to the guest in accordance with the
prevailing legal provisions for the items brought by
the guest to the Hotel. The Hotel recommends using
the main Hotel safe or bedroom safe. If the guest
wishes to bring to the hotel money, securities or
valuables to a value in excess of EUR 800, or other
items to a value of over EUR 3,500, it must make a
separate safekeeping agreement with the Hotel.£
3. If the Hotel provides the guest with a parking space in
the Hotel garage or car park, including for a charge,
this does not constitute a safekeeping agreement. In
the event of the loss of or damage to motor vehicles
while parked or being driven on the Hotel’s grounds,
or to the contents thereof, the Hotel is only liable
pursuant to subsection XIV 1, sentences 1 to 4 above.
The Hotel will take all due care in complying with
requests for wake-up calls. Messages, mail and
consignments of goods for guests will be handled with
care. The Hotel will deal with the delivery,
safekeeping and, on request and for a charge,
dispatch of the same. In this respect too the Hotel is
only liable pursuant to subsection XIV 1, sentences
sentences 1 to 4 above.£
XV. Right to Refuse Admittance or Eject Guests
The Hotel is entitled to refuse a guest admittance to
the Hotel or accommodation therein if on the guest’s
arrival it has good grounds for believing that the
guest is under the influence of drugs or alcohol or
otherwise behaves in an offensive manner towards
hotel staff or other guests. The Hotel is entitled to
eject a guest from the Hotel and cancel without
notice its existing Contract with that guest if he or
she repeatedly disturbs the peace or causes a
nuisance for other guests or hotel staff.£
XVI. Closing Provisions
Any amendments or supplements to the Contract, the
[provisions governing] acceptance of orders or to
these General Terms and Conditions must be made in
writing. Any unilateral amendments or supplements
made by the guest are hereby null and void.£
The place of commercial performance and payment is
the registered office of the relevant Hotel.£
The exclusive place of jurisdiction over commercial
matters, including disputes relating to cheques, is the
Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg. However, if it so
chooses the Hotel may also take legal action against
a guest at the seat of the relevant Hotel or guest. The
same applies if the guest meets the conditions of
Section 38 paragraph 2 of the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung - ZPO) and does not
have any general place of jurisdiction in Germany.£
These General Terms and Conditions are governed by
German law, to the exclusion of UN sales law and
legal provisions governing conflicts of law.£"
